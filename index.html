        <p>Injurys happen all around the world. Some injury can be severe and could effect the way you live your life and some just leave a little mark that will heal after some time. Either way you put it no one likes injurys at all it just ruins your life until it gets healed. Athletes get injured very often. They are playing various sports that require a lot of contact and movement. It is proven that approximately 21 percent of brain injuries among american children are from sports. People never know when someone could get hurt playing the sport or just when there is something wrong with there body health like heart rate and blood pressure and things that you could not just see by looking at someone. So what I decided to do was think of ways that I can tell when a person is in danger or when they are about to get injured. I thought of making a system of devices and cameras that will keep track of players biometrics and their physical state. I brought together 3 different devices. All of these devices have their own job. They will help gather this important information on the players and store it into one single computer. We will be able to detect when soemone is having problems with in their bodys and stop them from playing before anything tragic happens.</p>

    <p class="card-text">These cameras are very important to my product. These cameras keep players and athletes on watch. By looking through them we can just make sure they are not acting weird or differetn then they usually do and if they are we can just speak to them about their problem. Sometimes players like to try and hide injuries.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Wristbands</h5>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">FITFORT Fitness Tracker</h6>
    <p class="card-text">What's special about these wristbands is that it keeps track of someone's heart rate, blood pressure and their calorie count. This will help us make sure that their blood pressure and heart rate does not get too high and they have a sufficient amount of calories before playing their game. This is very important because if someones blood pressure is too high it could cause headaches and difficult breathing which is very important when being so active. If someones heart rate gets to high they will get light headed and feel dizzy and they could possibly faint. These bands are very snug and do not come off easy so you can play with it on because it will not get caught on anything. </p>

    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">LG Gram Laptop</h6>
    <p class="card-text">We have computers that have all the players' physicals like their height, weight and wingspan. When we have all of these valuable physicals we could tell if someone is taking performance enhancers which increase weight quite a lot. This will help us keep track of all the information on the wristbands. We will have their heart rate, blood pressure and calorie count gathered from the other devices next to the player name and picture. This computer can hold a lot of different things. It has a TB of storage which is very important to use for the many athletes we will keep track of.</p>
